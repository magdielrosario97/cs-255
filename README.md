# CS-255 System Analysis and Design Portfolio

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a company called DriverPass, whose goal was to enhance driving test preparation through structured training and testing programs. The client, Liam, wanted a system that could facilitate both online practice exams and in-person training sessions to better prepare students for their driving tests. This system needed to be accessible online, support various user roles, and handle scheduling and tracking of training sessions effectively. 

### What did you do particularly well?
What I did well in this project was create a system that integrated the client's requirements with various functionalities such as scheduling, user management, and ability to run on various platforms. I was able to create various types of requirements through a transcribed meeting, showing my ability to create business requirement documents and UML diagram.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to rework my business requirement document. I believe it could be expanded with more information as my knowledge continues to grow. A simple revision over the meeting transcription can show some details I may have overlooked during the course.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I utilized personal knowledge and critical thinking skills to draft requirements that meet the user's needs. I employed reviewing skills and gathered information from the client to gain a better understanding of what was required. It is best to align our requirements with their needs to ensure a common goal is achieved. A technically sound product is not efficient without a user. 

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In future projects, I want to incorporate more data analytics to create diverse systems. This could be done by integrating analytics capabilities directly into systems, allowing real-time data processing and feedback. Additionally, the Information Systems plan to create systems that help build information systems and technologies that meet organizational.
